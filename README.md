# Email-Authorization-Through-Extension
This platform renders directly within email platforms as an extension. The primary goal of the project is to provide users with seamless access to key features and interactions, both via a traditional web app and directly within their email clients.

📨 Email-Based Extension Platform
In addition to the web app, the project includes an innovative component that renders an interactive interface directly within email platforms, functioning as an extension or embedded widget. This enables users to interact with the application from within their inbox, without needing to visit the standalone web page.

🛡️ Highlights of the email-integrated extension:

💎 Direct embedding within email body or sidebar, depending on platform support (e.g., Gmail Add-ons or Outlook Extensions).

💎 Consistent user experience that mirrors the web app interface.

💎 Real-time functionality, such as form submissions, previews, or status updates.

💎 Context-aware behavior, such as reacting to email content or user metadata.
